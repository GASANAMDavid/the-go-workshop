Go is UTF-8 compliant language i.e you can declare variables' names using alphabets other than latin alphabets

**Note** 
Not all programming languages allow you to use UTF- 8 characters as variables and function names. This feature could be one of the reasons why Go has become so popular in Asian countries, particularly in China.
